<div class="bio">
  <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
  <p>The way we express our emotions whether in the form of desires or in the form of our actions, has always intrigued me and over time, has led me to experiment with different areas and forms of interpersonal connection.
    The current challenges we are going through have demonstrated yet again what for many is not new: the need to use the digital world as a way to reach customers and potential customers.
    My desire to communicate and interact more effectively, combined with my particular taste for the digital world made me bet on three areas that I consider fundamental for the future of organizations: Web Design, Web Development and Digital Marketing.
    These three areas combined help the organizations in the pursuit of their major objectives. With the exponential growth of the online market, it is essential that companies have all the tools at their disposal, so that their resources are optimized when reaching their target audience. Another equally important point is that companies, despite communicating in the digital world, do not forget such a basic human principle: interaction.As in the physical world, an entrepreneur has to understand the environment in which his activity is inserted, he must also do so in the digital world trying to understand the context of his market segment in the most detailed way possible, to be able to create and distribute the relevant content for their target audience, to be able to interact conveniently and to establish lasting and profitable relationships for both parties.The need to understand the digital context as an extension of the physical world, to humanize the interactions of actors in social media networks is an extra motivation for me because the sale of a product or service starts at the moment of its conception.Being the bridge between the Brand and its Customers, building with them an effective digital strategy, to be able to predict in a more effective way all the key points of their promotional campaigns is a challenge that I always propose while working.
